        <h3>My name is Aleks and I am a fullstack JavaScript software developer with a keen eye for design.</h3>
        <p>I wasnâ€™t born a natural programmer. As a matter of fact, I was born an artist. I became a programmer who enjoys solving challenges in a creative way. Art and tech, for me, is a perfect union, two elements that fulfill and compliment one another.
        I love to learn new things, no matter how tough, and I love to teach others. No matter how tough.
        </p>
